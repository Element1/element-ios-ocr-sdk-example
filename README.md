# Element iOS OCR SDK

## Version support

The Element OCR iOS SDK supports iOS 10 and above.

## Using the demo application

Follow these steps (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Element1/element-ios-face-sdk-local-example/master/README.md) to copy the Element iOS Face SDK framework and bundles to the sample project and update the sample app's bundle identifier.

You can follow the same steps to copy your Element iOS OCR SDK.

To run the demo app, click on the arrow on the top left:

![run](https://github.com/Element1/element-ios-ocr-sdk-example/raw/master/images/run.png "run")

- Note that the XCode project is set to "Automatically manage signing" so you will need to be signed into your Apple developer account in order to run the demo app on your phone (see https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1814/_index.html).
